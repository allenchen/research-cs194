      # Simply call "xapit" on a class and pass a block to define the indexed attributes.
      # 
      #   class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     xapit do |index|
      #       index.text :name, :content
      #       index.field :category_id
      #       index.facet :author_name, "Author"
      #       index.sortable :id, :category_id
      #     end
      #   end
      # 
      # First we index "name" and "content" attributes for full text searching. The "category_id" field is indexed for :conditions searching. The "author_name" is indexed as a facet with "Author" being the display name of the facet. See the facets section below for details. Finally the "id" and "category_id" attributes are indexed as sortable attributes so they can be included in the :order option in a search.
      # 
      # Because the indexing happens in Ruby these attributes do no have to be database columns. They can be simple Ruby methods. For example, the "author_name" attribute mentioned above can be defined like this.
      # 
      #   def author_name
      #     author.name
      #   end
      # 
      # This way you can create a completely custom facet by simply defining your own method
      # 
      # You can also pass any find options to the xapit method to determine what gets indexed and improve performance with eager loading or a different batch size.
      # 
      #   xapit(:batch_size => 100, :include => :author, :conditions => { :visible => true })
      #
      # If you pass in a block you can customize how the text words will be devided (instead of by simply white space).
      # 
      #   xapit do |index|
      #     index.text(:keywords) { |words| words.split(', ') }
      #   end
      # 
      # You can specify a :weight option to give a text attribute more importance. This will cause search terms matching
      # that attribute to have a higher rank. The default weight is 1. Decimal (0.5) weight values are not supported.
      #
      #   index.text :name, :weight => 10
      #
