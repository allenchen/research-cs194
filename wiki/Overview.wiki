#summary The purpose of the project and setup instructions.

= Overview =

ResearchMatch is an open-source Web application intended for use by university departments interested in facilitating for their students the process of finding undergraduate research. Written in Ruby on Rails, ResearchMatch is a student-developed application designed with ease of use and flexibility in mind. It is characterized by the following features:
  * CAS authentication and LDAP bindings to receive basic information regarding student data; 
  * Smart matching of undergraduate positions with students based on their interests, courses, and experience; 
  * Minimal interaction on behalf of professors, who can then focus on their work and delegate research administrivia to their graduate students;
  * In-app application for positions and uploading of documents such as resumes and transcripts.


= Setup =

Deploying ResearchMatch on your own development server is simple. You will need the following backend tools installed:

  * MySQL
  * _Sphinx (this may not be necessary; I believe the ThinkingSphinx plugin already handles this from within the app)_
  * Rails 2.3

Specifically, the following packages are recommended for setting up ResearchMatch on a Linux box (e.g. Ubuntu):

  * ruby-dev
  * ruby
  * mysql-server

To launch the app, run the following:

`rake ts:reindex
rake ts:start
ruby script/server`

To terminate the app, run the following:

`^C _(to terminate the Ruby server)_
rake ts:stop`
